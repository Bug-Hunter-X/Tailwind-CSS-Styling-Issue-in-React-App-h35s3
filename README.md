# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue in React App

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when integrating Tailwind CSS into a React application. The button in the application does not have the expected styling as defined by the Tailwind CSS classes.

## Bug Description

The button element in the `App` component is intended to have a blue background, white text, and a rounded border. However, it renders without any styling applied.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and that the Tailwind directives are correctly imported into the React component.  The fix may involve checking the `tailwind.config.js` file and ensuring the correct CSS is being generated, as well as making sure the `@tailwind` directives are properly placed in the CSS file being used by your React application. This is often a problem of setup rather than a code error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that the button lacks the expected Tailwind CSS styling.

## Resolved Bug

The bug has been resolved by correctly configuring the Tailwind CSS build process and importing the necessary Tailwind directives in the component.
